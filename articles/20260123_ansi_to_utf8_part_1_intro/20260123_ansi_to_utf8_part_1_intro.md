# 20260123 ANSI to UTF8 Part 1: Intro

## Introduction

I love using the terminal in Linux. Over the years I've customised it
so that it's a joy for me to use, and I always relish in discovering something new that improves my experience.

Over the last few months I have fallen in love with ANSI art - pixel art from the 90s that first appeared in BBS (Bulletin Board Systems).

This art looks amazing when displayed in the Linux terminal, however there are many challenged, caveats & edge cases when doing this.

This is a <N> part series on the topic of converting this art to UTF-8.
