This article contains some handy tips and tricks around running Minecraft clients and servers, particularly in Linux

## Locations

```shell
$HOME/.minecraft/shaderpacks/1.18.2/
$HOME/.minecraft/mods/--
```

## Mods & Shaders

There isn't a way to fully automate the download of mods & shaders, as [curseforge.com](curseforge.com) the site that normally hosts the files doesn't host files at static URLS.

One bit of advice would be - for each major version of the minecraft client that you use, download all of the jars and store them in a "backup" location that you can use later if needed.

### Recommendations - Mods

These links will trigger the "latest" download for each tool

- [Fabric Loader](https://maven.fabricmc.net/net/fabricmc/fabric-installer/0.10.2/fabric-installer-0.10.2.jar) (used to load mods)
- [OptiFabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric/download) (allows you to run OptiFine & Fabric together)
- [Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematifca/download) (creates/loads schematic overlays)
    - [MaLiLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/malilib/download) (dependency of Litematica)
