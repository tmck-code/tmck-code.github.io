# 20220718 CSGO surf

https://github.com/tmck-code/tmck-code.github.io/blob/99a7ae73cbad733c9e55a7f1762eb7f786668676/articles/20220718-csgo-surf/surf.cfg

You'll need to write this into a file in the "cfg" directory of your CSGO installation.

```bash
# In most cases this is something like:
STEAM_HOME="$HOME/.local/share/Steam"
# In my case, I use a shared partition to store my steam games, so for me its:
STEAM_HOME="/mnt/X/SteamLibrary"
```

After setting the `$STEAM_HOME` variable in your shell, you can use the following command to write the config file.

```bash
# Now, you can 
vim "$STEAM_HOME/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/cfg/surf.cfg"
```

Now, in CS:GO, you can use the tilde (~) character to open the terminal, and type and run the following command to load this config file:

```shell
exec surf
```

You can go one step further and _bind_ this to a key! I use the "p" key

```shell
bind p "exec surf"
```
